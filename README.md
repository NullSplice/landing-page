# Landing Page Project (from The Odin Project)

<strong>Start Date:</strong> 29 August 2025

This landing page was built as part of the CSS Foundations section of The Odin Project. The main goal was to design and style a complete webpage layout from scratch, applying what I had learned about:
* Organizing content with Flexbox
* Using CSS rules to control spacing, alignment, and visual balance
* Working with typography and colors to create hierarchy
* Combining images and text into a clean, structured design

As I progress, I plan to revisit this project to make it fully responsive, improve accessibility, and refine the overall look and feel.
